<h1>XSLT crash course</h1>

<p>This should be fun. Going to deliver a <strong>full-day training course on XSLT</strong> to about a dozen <a href="http://www.portalsystems.de">PortalSystems Consulting</a> colleagues..</p>
<p>My voice will be dried out by the time this is over (this was certainly the case after my last full-day workshop on SharePoint design customization that I delivered to <i>Solarlux</i> IT pros last week), but if you have not gotten around to getting to grips with XSLT yet, it is such a shame that I'm offering you this free <a href="files/blog/xslt.zip">download of my crash course</a> including the PPTX slides (German-only!) and some code samples.</p>
