<h1>Auto-indent Show-ables with 43 deps..</h1>
<div class="ml-info">
(The <i>actual</i> Haskell code snippet at the bottom-of-page &mdash; but first, some ranty ruminations ;)
</div>
<p>
	Any programmer often needs to output live data temporarily for inspection,
	serialized in a structured-but-human-readable format (think JSON) and
	in Haskell, using {X|c:show|} on any {X|c:Show|}able does this brilliantly.
	Alas it's missing indentation of course, its primary
	purpose being reproducable roundtrippable serialization.
	This is fine until it isn't (eg. with many 1000s of output
	"lines"-when-wrapped for just 4 {X|c:Show|}ables while interoperating with Cabal).
</p>
{X|h2:So you look for a lib|}
<p>
	Something lean only for temporary-developer-debugging-diagnostics-troubleshooting
	purposes, to be discarded when the code in question has solidified. Luckily you
	find just such a thing: roughly paraphrased (I don't want to rain on anyone's
	open-source libraries after all! it's not about that), its description reads <i>"this
	is simple-but-robust: we don't fully parse Haskell syntax of {X|c:Show|}able outputs,
	instead we just insert line-breaks and indentation reacting on commas, parentheses etc.
	This makes it robust even in the face of non-Haskell-syntax {X|c:Show|}able outputs".</i>
	Sounds brilliant! Exactly what's needed, just the necessary <i>mere modicum</i> of
	readability that indentation and line-wrappings afford us, without needing to code {X|c:Show|}
	instances for 3rd-party {X|c:data|} types. Let's {X|c:stack install|} it and give it a try!
</p>
{X|h2:Only 2 dependencies..|}
<p>
	Wait first quickly look at the dependencies.. ah well, "only 2" besides {X|c:base|}:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>ansi-wl-pprint</b>, "a pretty printing library based on Wadler's paper A Prettier
	Printer, enhanced with support for ANSI terminal colored output" &mdash; uh-huh.. well let's see how
	that plays with outputting on Windows to console windows, SublimeText's output log or temp files..</li>
	<li><b>trifecta</b>, "modern parser combinator library with slicing and Clang-style colored diagnostics"
	&mdash; booy, fancy that! Again with the colors and what, now we <i>do</i> need some parsing action after all?</li>
</ul>
{X|h2:..no wait, it's 43|}
<p>
	Anyway, you forget to remember that these 2 dependencies mean many more cascading dependencies and you
	still give it a try in your fresh library project. Immediately, {X|c:stack|} commands that you now list
	in the project's {X|c:stack.yaml|} a whopping additional 43 {X|c:extra-deps|} because they don't come
	out-of-box with the standard Haskell (Stack) distribution:

{X|h2:Why is this rantworthy|}
<p>Now in how many ways might this impede perhaps not all or most, but certainly "some" (aka. me) &mdash;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any downstream package that will depend on this library project (and you know today there
		<i>will</i> be numerous) will need all these too (at least when referenced from {X|c:custom-setup|}
		or {X|c:explicit-setup-deps|} &mdash; and you know today that <i>will</i> be so).</li>
	<li>
		Once the code-base has stabilized and there's no need for {X|c:Show|}able outputs,
		will you remember to remove these? Oh but by now some other dependency might depend on 1 of these
		43! All doable, yes; all workable, sure; all a major annoyance with regards to "developer flow".
	</li>
	<li>Of course you end up with some IO/buffering abort/error message situation half-way through the
		output. I know, I know, time to go Linux/Unix/Posix and ditch Windows. <i>It would  only take a day
		or so, after all</i>, to go from my machine's currently fully well-known stability/solidity/robustness
		to a new, hard-to-predict state of things. And I <i>do</i> like the Unices (my Windows is a leftover from
		3D / OpenGL hacking last few years &mdash; I know how to make it lean, fast, reliable and resilient).
		Anyway, mission failed, proper desired output not attainable.</li>
	<li>Of course {X|c:.stack-work|} blew up from under-1MB (for a fairly fresh library package) to over-100MB,
		but that's inconsequential nowadays &mdash; except <i>for the <b>utterly trivial</b> use-case at hand,
		just seems so unnecessarily wasteful</i> (not the original library author's fault of course! &mdash;my
		use-case certainly wasn't his job to predict). Once you go down this path, you soon lose all discipline
		and the more your code-base grows out of hand, the more ready you and others will be to abandon it (yes,
		I count many dozens of dependencies instead of a dozen LoC "a code-base growing out of hands", because
		there <i>will</i> be conflicts, install errors, support issues in the future as some of these grow stale
		and the rest of the ecosystem evolves further &mdash; 3rd-party deps are both assets and liabilities..)
		</li>
</ul>
{X|h2:Just code the thing|}
<p>So one does what has always worked well in the past, get one's hands dirty and get coding. The trend for the last
few years was of course "a personal blog / CMS / ERP / Facebook clone in 3 lines" but ignoring such tomfoolery, we end
up with 20 lines for the most basic, brute-force, naive auto-indenting-and-line-wrapping of {X|c:Show|}able outputs
&mdash; geared towards record-dominant outputs, not parens-dominant (so not suited for such ADT structures).</p>

<p>Spot a bug? Let me know. Can make the same thing more succinct? Let me know! Have a "cool"
feature idea, a way to generalize this or allow for more parameterization or
react-on-parens-and-brackets-too-not-just-braces? Then how about you write a library package that
needs ~43 dependencies and put it up on Hackage..  ;)</p>
<p>Outputs still look "mildy odd" (compared to "proper code" or hand-authored such representations)
when you don't parse certain contexts and then especially-format with regards to those, but that's OK,
at least not "majorly irritating" and I have what I <i>actually needed</i> (some basic indentation and
appropriate line-breaks) and <i>nothing else</i>. And this is one of those coding needs that comes
back again and again and again, so good to not need to carry these 43 unneeded, untested, unknown,
unscrutinized (for now!) dependencies over to all kinds of current and upcoming projects &mdash; <b>at
least for such a mundane and transient purpose</b>!</p>
<p>I know, of course: "Stack makes handling dependencies a non-issue" (except needing to manually list
not just 2 immediate ones but also the other 41 indirect ones for this current library project and all
downstream "importers"!) and most probably the compilation pipeline never links what isn't actually
used in code, but still! "Leanness", frugality, "<a href="http://suckless.org">sucklessness</a>" begins
at home, in your backyard! Except for throwaway projects of course, there anything goes.</p>
